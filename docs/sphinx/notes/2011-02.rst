pyprocgame 1.x (Development) Release Notes
==========================================

The following change notes are a summary of changes since `1.0 <https://github.com/preble/pyprocgame/tree/1.0>`_:

pyprocgame
----------

	- Changed named parameter for :meth:`procgame.game.Driver.patter`: ``orig_on_time`` is now ``original_on_time``, to be consistent with pypinproc and other existing methods.
	- Added child modes.  See :meth:`procgame.game.Mode.add_child_mode` for more details.
	- :meth:`procgame.game.Mode.delay` now has more optional parameters, and will autogenerate a unique name and return it.
	- Added :meth:`procgame.dmd.Font.draw_in_rect`.
	- Added :attr:`procgame.dmd.TextLayer.fill_color`.
	- :attr:`procgame.game.Switch.hw_timestamp` is now set when available.
	- Added :attr:`procgame.modes.ScoreDisplay.credit_string_callback`.
	- :meth:`procgame.dmd.DisplayController.update` now returns the frame it generated.
	- Added ``dmdimage`` tool.
	- Game configuration file: game items (switches, coils, and lamps) can now have a ``tags`` key. This allows obtaining game items with a certain tag via :meth:`procgame.game.AttrCollection.items_tagged`.
	- Fixed an issue where :meth:`procgame.game.Switch.time_since_change` did not behave as documented. Previously, querying :meth:`time_since_changed` would always return 0 if called within that switch's handler. Now the time will be properly reset *after* the switch's events are handled.
